PHP AutoInstaller
=================

This automatically installs PHP on Windows for those of you who don't understand how to on your own.

Instructions
------------

Simply open the Run.bat file and sit back and watch.  Once it finishes, it will tell you that you may have to restart your computer.  If you have Windows 7, you should not have to restart your computer.  For those of you with Windows XP or older, or Windows 8, I do believe you will have to restart your computer in order to refresh the System PATH.
